# Hardware #
* ATMega chips (328, mostly)
* USB (data and power)
* Lots of IO (digital/analog)

.notes Show board (if you haven't already). Talk about analog ins and PWMs and whatever else. Pass board around.

# Open Hardware #
* Chip is non-proprietary
* Schematics are open...
* ...so there are *lots* of clones
* *Name* is trademarked.

.notes This is intentional. Jillion billion clones, yet Arduino still in business, still makes money. Show your clone if you brought it. Note that Arduinos are around $25-$30 from digikey.
